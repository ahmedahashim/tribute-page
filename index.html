<p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election.</p>
        <p>In South Africa, quoting Mandela carried with it the threat of a criminal record and a possible prison sentence. Under the apartheid regime, people who were banned or imprisoned could not be quoted, and Mandela was successively banned from December 1952 and was in custody from 5 August 1962 until 11 February 1990.</p>

          <h3> Facts about Childhood</h3>
        </header>
         
      
   <p>Mandela was born into the Xhosa culture.
The Xhosa culture is the second-largest cultural group in South Africa. They are smaller only than the Zulu, who are their long-term rivals despite numerous cultural similarities. The Xhosa are known for being a peaceful people and live mainly in the southern part of the country.</p>
        <p>He was a member of a royal family and was next in line to be chief.Nelson Mandela’s mother was the third of his father’s four wives. The chief is expected to take multiple wives from different families within the tribe. Through them, Mandela had nine sisters and three brothers.</p>
        <p>One of the more surprising facts about Nelson Mandela’s childhood is that Mandela’s given name at birth was Rolihlahla. In Xhosa, this means “pulling the branch off the tree” or “troublemaker”. The English name Nelson was given to Mandela by a schoolteacher. This was a common practice among black South Africans.Although born into a family of importance, Mandela was the first to gain a formal education. He received this as part of his grooming for future leadership.</p>
        <p>
          Mandela went on to college at the University of Fort Hare. This was an elite South African school that was the only “Western-style” higher education available to black citizens in the country.
        </p>
        <p>Mandela studied law at the University of Witwatersrand, where he earned a degree and became involved in the fight against racial discrimination that made him famous.</p>

        <h3>What people say about Mandela's legacy</h3>
        <p>“He’s gone home and we’ve lost one of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this Earth. He no longer belongs to us; he belongs to the ages. Through his fierce dignity and unbending will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa and moved all of us. His journey from a prisoner to a president embodied the promise that human beings and countries can change for the better.”</p>
       <div> <strong>Barak Obama</strong></div>
        <p>"A great light has gone out in the world. Nelson Mandela was a hero of our time, "I've asked for the flag at No10 to be flown at half mast."</p>
          <div><strong>David Cameron</strong></div>
       <p>"Mandela was a man, who devoted his life to the service of his people and the
fight for human dignity, equality and freedom for all."
       </p>
